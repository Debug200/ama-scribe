1. Does not account for outputs larger than 10k characters. Workaround: trial-and-error splitting of rows to get under character limit per comment. Be sure to add table header to each subsequent comment.
2. Takes several minutes to complete. Not sure how much is due to reddit API and how much is processing time.
3. Does not take into account certain markups in comments: links in OP's comments, quotes in comments, or multiple paragraphs in comments (I think I know how to fix this one).
